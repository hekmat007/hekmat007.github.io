<p style="color:black;text-align:center;font-size:20;font-family:Arial">Islam is a faith of pure monotheism that builds on the messages of previous prophets sent to humankind throughout history.
Islam is a continuation of the same message preached by all of God’s prophets — ending with the final prophet, Muhammad ﷺ — calling people to believe and worship in the one, true God alone. It is the original religion of Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus that clarifies the purpose of creation and guides us on how to live a Godly, righteous life.</b> 
<br><br>
<b>"Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allah, then indeed, Allah is swift in taking account." (Qur'an 3:19)</b>
