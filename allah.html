<p style="color:black;text-align:center;font-size:20;font-family:Arial">Allah is simply the Arabic word for God.<br><br>

<b>Say [O Prophet], “He is Allah—One. God, the eternal. He has never had offspring, nor was He born. And there is none comparable to Him.”

 (Qur’an 112: 1-4).</b><br><br>

The word ‘Allah’ does not have a gender or a plural form, indicating God’s uniqueness from all creation and His absolute oneness. Allah is also the term for ‘God’ used by non-Muslim Arabic speakers such as Arab Christians.<br><br>

The 99 Beautiful Names of God encapsulate the various divine attributes through which God has described Himself. Allah is not restricted to these names alone; rather, they are a means by which someone can begin to know Him. God, above all else in the Islamic worldview, is the Most Merciful and the Most Kind (these are the names most often repeated in the Qur’an and in daily prayers), the Most Loving, and the Source of all peace, reliance, and refuge. The gift of worship is from His bounty to keep mankind forever connected to Him.<br><br>

<b>“He is God: there is no god other than Him. It is He who knows what is hidden as well as what is in the open, He is the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy. He is God: there is no god other than Him, the Controller, the Holy One, Source of Peace, Granter of Security, Guardian over all, the Almighty, the Compeller, the Truly Great; God is far above anything they consider to be His partner. He is God: the Creator, the Originator, the Shaper. The best names belong to Him. Everything in the heavens and earth glorifies Him: He is the Almighty, the Wise.” [Quran, 59:22-24]</b></p>
