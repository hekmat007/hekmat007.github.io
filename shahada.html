<p style="color:black;text-align:center;font-size:20;font-family:Arial">The shahada is to believe in the message of Islam and declare that: <b>There is no god but Allah (God), and Muhammad ﷺ is the Messenger of God.</b><br><br>

This testimony of faith, known in Arabic as the shahada, encapsulates the religion of Islam. It must be affirmed in the heart and uttered by the tongue. <br><br>

The shahada is a declaration of monotheism (tawhid) stating that there is absolutely no deity except for the one, true, creator: God. He has no partners in divinity, no children, and none are worthy of worship except Him.<br><br>

It is also a statement of acceptance that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is God’s final prophet and messenger.</p>
