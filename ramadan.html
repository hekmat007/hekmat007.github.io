<p style="color:black;text-align:center;font-size:20;font-family:Arial">Ramadan is the <b>9th month of the Hijri, or Islamic lunar calendar</b>, during which Muslims are obligated to fast each day of the entire month. <br><br>

Fasting entails abstaining from food, drink, and intimacy from sunrise to sunset. <b>All sane, mature Muslims are obligated to fast unless they have a legitimate excuse</b> (due to travel, illness, etc.), in which case Islamic law details if and how they are to make up for missed Ramadan fasts. <br><br>

The month of Ramadan is also the month in which the revelation of God’s final message to humanity, the Qur’an, began. The Qur’an was first revealed on the <b>Night of Decree (laylat al-qadr), which is described as the greatest night of the entire year</b>.<br><br>
<b>Indeed, it is We Who sent this Quran down on the Night of Glory. And what will make you realize what the Night of Glory is? The Night of Glory is better than a thousand months. That night the angels and the holy spirit descend, by the permission of their Lord, for every decreed matter. It is all peace until the break of dawn.


 

 (Qur’an 97: 1-5).</b>
