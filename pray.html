<p style="color:black;text-align:center;font-size:20;font-family:Arial">Prayer (salah) forges and sustains an essential connection between a person and their Creator.<br><br>

Muslims have been instructed by God to pray five times daily within prescribed times. The Qurâ€™an informs us that the primary reason for our creation and existence is to worship God, and these required five daily prayers are, in essence, a foundational fulfillment of this existential purpose.</b> </p>
