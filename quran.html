<p style="color:black;text-align:center;font-size:20;font-family:Arial">The Qur’an is the speech of God revealed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ through the Angel Gabriel (Jibril) over a period of 23 years.<br><br>

The Qur’an constitutes the final revealed message from God through the last prophet and messenger sent to the world.<br><br>

The Qur’an is both miraculously preserved and inimitable,<b> "It is certainly We Who have revealed the Reminder, and it is certainly We Who will preserve it" (Qur’an 15: 9)</b>. In other words, what we know as the Qur’an today is the exact same text that was revealed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. The Qur’an is also miraculous in that it is impossible for human beings to imitate, contains no errors or contradictions, accurately foretells future events, describes matters of the natural world unknown to human beings at the time of revelation, and contains benefit for all human beings. </p>
