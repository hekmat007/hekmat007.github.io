<p style="color:black;text-align:center;font-size:20;font-family:Arial">All Muslims must perform the Hajj once in a lifetime, if they are physically and financially able to do so. Among other things, the pilgrimage <b>is a commemoration of the legacy and sacrifices of Prophet Abraham (Ibrahim), peace be upon him, and his family.</b><br><br>

The <b>rituals of Hajj are full of powerful symbolism and lessons,</b> and experiencing them can bring about profound spiritual change.<br><br>

 <b>Our Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near Your sacred House, our Lord, that they may establish prayer. So make hearts among the people incline toward them and provide for them from the fruits that they might be grateful.

 (Qurâ€™an 14:37).</b>
