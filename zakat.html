<p style="color:black;text-align:center;font-size:20;font-family:Arial">Zakat refers to an obligatory portion of wealth a Muslim must give annually to the poor and needy. <br><br>

Islamic law details the various types of wealth that are zakat-eligible, how it is calculated, and the specific categories of people eligible to receive it. <br><br>

Zakat is frequently mentioned alongside prayer (salat) throughout the Qur’an and was a ubiquitous feature of all prophetic calls. Among the five pillars of Islam, zakat is unique in that, in addition to being an act of devotion to God, it plays an important social function. While things like prayer and fasting are, on their face, individual acts of ritual devotion, zakat directly benefits one’s community and, as an institution, wields immense economically and socially transformative power.</p>
